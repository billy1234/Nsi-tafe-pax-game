all assets are to be placed in their apropriate folder ie c# files go in scripts ect

when an artist gives you an art asset it is to be placed in the art imports folder,
once done drag the object into the scene and save it as a prefab, DO NOT use the art 
import folder to add assets to the scene, additionaly the auto generated materials that come
with meshes should also be left in the artImports folder and on the prefab the actual materials 
must be added to the necicary material slot


every time a script is written all documenation for it must be named the same as the script
and droped in the documenation folder, ie backflip.cs  would have a file called backflip.txt in
the documenation folder.
