Ai Base

this abstract class handles all common ai behavior
	it handles and changes its state (patrol, atack, kite back)
	it has its own recursive loop ailoop so every x seconds it may evaluate its
		surroundings outside of uptdate, fixedupdate ect
	it has its own abstract event methords for when the unit finds or losses a
	target 
	it also will tell the aipathfinding script to move but the aipathfinding script is not 
	required (so this can be used on turrets ect)
	
	
	
Ai Pathfinding
	just a wrapper class that will alow any implementation of base ai
	to move, patrol(to the pre set nodes specified in a stattic array)
	and kite back(walk away from the player)

Basic Ai
	a super basic implementation of the AiBase class with no added features
