Discription; a heath class for all objects that will take damage

Instructions;

-to set unit hp- just set maxHp in inspector and the hp will become this at start

-Using health events- first write the behavior in a seperate script then refence the
desired health script and += the function to the desired events-

	example;(in awake if posible)  myHealth.OnDie += turnScrreenRed;
	
	turn scrren red being a void function in a seperate script
	myHealth being a Health Script note how += was used rather than
	= to prevent earlier behaviors from being removed

-to damage/heal- simply modify hp
